# Introduction
## Core concept
Prifina provides a personal computing platform in the cloud for individuals to manage their personal data and empower them to activate their data in fundamentally new ways. For developers and service providers, Prifina provides a platform to develop and publish new types of personal applications and personalized experiences for their customers.
## Data control
### Profile cards
Prifina users have the ability to create **profile cards**. These cards consist of aggregated and anonymized personal data designed to be shared with third parties without identifying the particular user. Profile cards allow third party services to provide personalized content and interactions with users, without the need for an account or unique authentication system.

## Prifina apps
Prifina's goal is to provide a platform where users are empowered through having absolute control over their data and its accessibility, and where developers are empowered to create a new kind of data-driven experience for users, while respecting their data privacy.

**Prifina apps can be classified into one of [three categories](https://medium.com/prifina/build-3-types-of-data-apps-with-prifina-7db735e14590):**

### Profile apps
Profile apps can exist outside of Prifina's platform and access data from Prifina users' profile cards. In a profile app, a user can choose their desired level of anonymity while still providing the application developer with enough data to provide enhanced and personalized content.
### Data widgets
Data widgets are Prifina's dashboard apps. Once installed through Prifina's native marketplace, they become available on a user's Prifina dashboard. Data widgets can safely have greater access to a user's data, because they are running locally in the user's Personal Private Cloud. In the case of data widgets, no data ever leaves the user's control.
### Local data apps
Like data widgets, local data apps run in the user's Personal Private Cloud. Local data apps are granted explicit permissions by the user regarding data access, and are able to communicate with other Prifina apps as well as with third party platforms. Local data apps can be extended beyond Prifina's platform to provide immersive and convenient experiences
